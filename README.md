## Features
The project uses various voice-related features, including fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer, and other acoustic measures, to train a machine learning model for Parkinson's disease prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains voice recordings from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryam643/parkinsons-disease-prediction.git
   cd parkinsons-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
2. Run the cells or script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the model.
3. Explore the results and predictions.

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using the scikit-learn library. You can find the details of the model, hyperparameters, and training process in the Jupyter Notebook (or Python script) named `train_model.ipynb` (or `train_model.py`).

## Results
The project achieved [mention any metrics or results obtained]. You can find detailed results and visualizations in the `results` folder.
